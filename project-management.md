# Project Management Document

## Index

## Vision (what is the ultimate goal of this project)
Benefits With Friends (BWF) is a website that allows people who work in retail, fast food, and other minimum wage jobs to come together and make use of their employee discounts. The goal of Benefits With Friends is that these people will be able to use this website as a way of couponing or saving money. 

## Configuration management plan (Github)
For source control, our group will be using Github. All documents and code will be uploaded to Github. Google Docs will also be used to edit documents for easier management when more than one member is working on the same document.

## Process Model

## Deliverables (executable, documentation, manuals)
The executable of BWF will be a website. Documentation of BWF is available for viewing purposes on GitHub while team members are able to edit documentation seen on GitHub.

## Potential risks (human risks, time risks, ressources risks, liability issues)
There is a security risk involved in this application since there is an account creation feature. The account feature keeps BWF's users' information secure, however there is always a chance of it failing as well.

## Team members (name, tasks, team style (egoless, chief programmer))
Team members include Jose Hernandez, Tuyet-Ngoc Le, Felipe Ronderos, Thanh Trinh, and Jerahmeel Wilson. Our team style will be using the chief programmer style.
